# Welcome to my [Portfolio](http://www.alexconstantine.com)!

## Portfolio Tech-Stack

This website was built using a combination of bootstrap and jquery. The application
was then compiled via webpack.

The contact form was created using the npm package, [emailjs](https://github.com/eleith/emailjs). Contact info
formatting is verified via jquery, and captcha support is provided by the [Google Captcha Plugin](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/).

Any additional dependencies are stores in [`package.json`](package.json).

## Viewing the Code

Please feel free to fork + clone this repository to examine how the website was built!

## Additional Information

This website is very much a work in progress. I began this website in July of 2017, but plan to
augment and upgrade its functionality to reflect my growth as a developer!
